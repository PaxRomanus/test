This is a series of essential revision questions from past HSC papers (c. 1992-2009). I tried to pick questions that are reasonably representative of the material; more difficult ones are marked with an asterisk *. I have put in mark allocations where given, but note that papers before 2001 do not have marks allocated for sub-parts of questions (i.e. part a is allocated 5 marks, but how those are broken over sub-parts i, ii and iii was not specified) and papers before 1995 have no mark allocations at all. Also note that this is not exhaustive - it is simply a selection. You may be examined on anything you have learned!
