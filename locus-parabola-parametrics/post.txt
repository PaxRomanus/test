Hi everyone. Here is a pair of nice locus problems I found while formulating the next problem set. The formula sheet is a relatively new invention and prior to its creation, many locus questions involved proving or deriving facts present on there, which can be a bit boring. However, the last couple of parts of these questions are slightly more interesting! Have fun.

Cheers,
