Hi everyone. Here is my solution to my morning commute question. Thanks to everyone who had a go and conducted interesting and fruitful discussion! I hope you enjoyed pondering over this problem as much as I did (I usually detest combinatorics, but this one was pretty good if I may say so myself :) ). If you have any questions, please do not hesitate!

Cheers,
